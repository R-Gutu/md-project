                      The new Bentley Continental GT Convertible sets new standards in craftsmanship, elegance and style. Designed and built by hand at the Bentley factory in England, it takes the exhilaration of open-air grand touring to thrilling new heights.<br><br>
                      The new Continental GT Convertible epitomises the spirit of grand touring. That’s why the 6.0 litre Bentley 12-cylinder engine beneath its bonnet delivers the perfect fusion of power and refinement.<br><br>  
                      With an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission for smooth, fast gear changes, it can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds (0 to 100 km/h in 3.8 seconds) and reach a top speed of 207 mph (333 km/h). Whilst travelling at speeds of up to 30 mph (50 km/h), the roof can still be open or closed.
